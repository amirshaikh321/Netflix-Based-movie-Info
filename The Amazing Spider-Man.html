            <h1>The Amazing Spider-Man</h1>
            <h2><b>Overview :</b></h2>
            <p>The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man which shares the title
             of the longest-running Spider-Man comic book series. It was produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Entertainment,
             Laura Ziskin Productions, Arad Productions, Inc., and Matt Tolmach Productions, and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the
             fourth theatrical Spider-Man film, serving as a reboot following Sam Raimi's 2002-2007 Spider-Man trilogy, and was followed by a second
             The Amazing Spider-Man film. The film was directed by Marc Webb and written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves, based
             on a story by Vanderbilt, and stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell
             Scott, Irrfan Khan, Martin Sheen, and Sally Field. In the film, Peter Parker is a high school student who gains spider-like powers after
             being bitten by a genetically modified spider. He uses his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man, but also faces personal challenges as he
             tries to balance his crime-fighting life with his ordinary life. He must also confront his past and uncover the truth behind his parents'
             disappearance, leading him to a confrontation with Dr. Curt Connors, a former colleague of his father who becomes the villainous Lizard.</p>

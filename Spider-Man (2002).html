            <h1>Spider-Man (2002)</h1>
            <h2><b>Overview :</b></h2>
            <p>Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. Directed by Sam Raimi from a screenplay by David Koepp,
                 it is the first installment in Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. The film stars Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, 
                 and Rosemary Harris. The story follows a timid teenager named Peter Parker who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a genetically engineered 
                 spider. He adopts the masked persona "Spider-Man" and begins to fight crime in New York City, facing the malevolent Green Goblin in the process.
                Development of a live-action Spider-Man film began in 1975, but stalled for nearly 25 years due to licensing and financial issues. Columbia Pictures finally
                 licensed the project for a worldwide release in 1999. David Koepp was hired to create a working screenplay, which was eventually rewritten by Scott Rosenberg
                  and refined by Alvin Sargent. Various directors were considered before Raimi was hired in 2000. Filming took place in Los Angeles and New York City from 
                  January to June 2001. Danny Elfman composed the musical score, while Sony Pictures Imageworks handled the visual effects.</p>
